# Realsense-camera-ROS2
This repository contains a package named RGBD_data, which handles data streaming from a RealSense RGB-D camera.  The realsense_pub.py script captures RGB-D data from the camera and publishes it to the rgb_frame topic.  The realsense_sub.py script subscribes to the rgb_frame topic to receive and display the published data.
